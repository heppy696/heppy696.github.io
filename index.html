          Wellness is an active process of becoming aware of and making choices
          toward a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is more than being free
          from illness, it is a dynamic process of change and growth.

          Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being,
          and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Health is a
          resource for everyday life, not the objective of living.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good health is not just the absence of disease or infirmity. It is a
          state of physical, mental, and social well-being. Having good health
          means being able to lead a full life with energy and happiness.
